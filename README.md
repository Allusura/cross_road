#cross_road
# A simple Python program I made 22 days of study in.

#Things I learned today:

# How to manipulate probability with a for loop,
# in this case, we had too many cars so we used a loop
# to generate a random number from 1-6 and if the number
# was 1, then we would spawn a car to limit the amount of 
# vehicles spawned at any given time.
